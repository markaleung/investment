This repository is my deep dive into investment and retirement spending. 

## Cape Expected Returns.xlsx
This is the source input data. It consists of inflation data by year, stock yields/returns by year, and bond yields/returns by year. 

## Cape Expected Returns 2.xlsx
This is the output data. It consists of:

- Saving/spending amount by year (all stocks, al bonds, 50/50) based on a spending formula determined in the notebook. 
- For stocks/bonds: actual future returns, actual future inflation, predicted future returns (based on yield), and difference between actual and predicted future returns. 

## Investment.ipynb
This is the notebook that does the deep dive, by reading the input, and writing to the output.
